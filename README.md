# CAN BUS Red Yellow Green Stoplight (can_ryg)
Summer project with CAN connected devices that simulate a stoplight. Three devices will take turns displaying red, yellow, and green. The status will be updated via a Wi-Fi GUI.

## Updates:

+ Future
+ 5/28/2022 - Still planning project. Identifying goals and possible paths towards those goals.
  + Ordered three SPI -> CAN development boards [(Amazon Purchase)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J9KZ4L4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Plan is to use RPI 4B, ESP32-WROOM32D, and an MSP432.
  + Installed Raspberry Pi OS (64 bit) on RPI 4B in preparation. Unsure of how SPI will be accessed.
  + Will likely use Arduino IDE for ESP32. SPI library exist.
  + Unsure of IDE for MSP432. Will decide later. Look into CCS / uVision. Look into CMSIS-DAP and libraries.
+ 5/26/2022 - Decided to begin project.
